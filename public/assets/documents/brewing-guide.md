# Brewing Guide: Huila, Colombia Single Origin

**Herb's House Coffee Partner Portal**

---

## About This Coffee

This medium-roast single origin comes from **Huila, Colombia**, one of the world's most celebrated coffee-growing regions. Located in southwestern Colombia within the Magdalena Valley and framed by the Andes mountains, Huila received **Denomination of Origin status in 2013**---the same distinction awarded to champagne and Roquefort cheese.

### The Varietals

This coffee is a blend of two exceptional Colombian varietals:

**Castillo**: Developed by Colombia's national coffee research center (Cenicafe) after 23 years of research, Castillo is known for its smooth body, clean aroma, and balanced cup profile. It performs on par with traditional heirloom varieties in blind taste tests, with some lots scoring above 90 points.

**Colombia**: A sister varietal to Castillo, also developed for disease resistance while maintaining excellent cup quality. Together, these varietals create a balanced, accessible cup.

### Flavor Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Primary Notes** | Milk chocolate, roasted almond |
| **Secondary Notes** | Mild citrus brightness, subtle caramel |
| **Body** | Medium, smooth |
| **Acidity** | Gentle, balanced |
| **Finish** | Clean, sweet, lingering nuttiness |

## General Brewing Principles

Before diving into specific methods, understanding these core principles will help you brew the best cup possible.

### The Golden Ratio

The Specialty Coffee Association recommends **55 grams of coffee per liter of water** (approximately 1:16 to 1:18 ratio). For this particular coffee, we recommend staying closer to **1:16** to fully showcase the chocolate and almond notes.

**Quick Reference:**
| Cups | Coffee | Water |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 cup (250ml) | 15-16g | 250ml |
| 2 cups (500ml) | 30-32g | 500ml |
| 4 cups (1L) | 55-60g | 1000ml |

### Water Temperature

For this medium roast, **brew between 195-200°F (90-93°C)**. This temperature range optimally extracts the chocolate and nutty characteristics while maintaining the gentle citrus brightness. Avoid exceeding 205°F, which can introduce bitterness and mask the delicate almond notes.

**Temperature Tips:**
- If your coffee tastes sour or thin: increase temperature slightly
- If your coffee tastes bitter or harsh: decrease temperature slightly
- After boiling water, let it rest 30-45 seconds before brewing

### Water Quality

Use filtered water that is:
- Free of chlorine odor
- Calcium hardness: 50-175 ppm
- pH: close to 7 (neutral)

Avoid distilled water (too flat) or heavily mineralized water (can taste harsh).

### Grind Fresh

Grinding immediately before brewing preserves the aromatic compounds that create the milk chocolate and citrus notes. Coffee begins losing freshness within 15-30 minutes of grinding.

### Storage

Store whole beans in an airtight container at room temperature, away from light and heat. Use within 2-4 weeks of the roast date for optimal flavor.

## Pour Over Methods

Pour over brewing excels at showcasing this coffee's clarity and balanced sweetness. The controlled pour highlights the milk chocolate and citrus notes beautifully.

### Hario V60

The V60's conical shape and spiral ridges create excellent extraction for this coffee's nuanced profile.

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Dose** | 15-16g |
| **Water** | 250ml |
| **Ratio** | 1:16 |
| **Grind** | Medium-fine (like table salt) |
| **Temperature** | 195-200°F (90-93°C) |
| **Total Time** | 2:30-3:00 |

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Rinse the filter** with hot water to remove paper taste and preheat the dripper. Discard rinse water.

2. **Add ground coffee** and create a small well in the center. Place on scale and tare.

3. **Bloom phase (0:00-0:45)**: Pour 30-40g of water in a slow spiral, starting from the center. The coffee will release CO2 and "bloom." Wait 30-45 seconds.

4. **First pour (0:45-1:15)**: Pour slowly in concentric circles until you reach 120-130g total. Avoid pouring directly on the filter walls.

5. **Second pour (1:15-1:45)**: Continue pouring in circles until you reach 200g total.

6. **Final pour (1:45-2:15)**: Complete your pour to reach 250g total.

7. **Drawdown**: Allow the coffee to drain completely. Total time should be 2:30-3:00.

**Tasting Notes to Expect**: Clean milk chocolate sweetness, subtle almond, gentle citrus acidity, smooth finish.

## Immersion Methods

Immersion brewing produces a fuller body that emphasizes the chocolate and almond characteristics while softening the citrus notes.

### French Press

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Dose** | 30g |
| **Water** | 500ml |
| **Ratio** | 1:16 |
| **Grind** | Coarse (like sea salt) |
